# Password Generator

## A simple password generator, interacting with the html elements, and collecting user inputs from a series of validated prompts

### Deployment / Code Repository

[Live deployment](https://tweetingcynical.github.io/password-generator/)

[Repository](https://github.com/TweetingCynical/password-generator)

### Scope and Purpose

Build a password generator which asks the user how many characters they would like to include, and the type of those characters.

### Installation

N/A

### Pseudocode

Steps to achieving the working generator:

* Declare variables needed for the process:
  - Different character types;
  - Password length choice;
  - Booleans for included character types;
* User confirm messages to get character type selection;
  - Check that user has made at least one choice;
* Concat the character type choices into one array;
* Function to handle producing a random number between two ints x and y inclusive;
* While newPassword < passwordLenChoice, choose random from concat, add to newPassword string;
* Display password in passwordText textbox in html

### Overview of Build

Some of the key JavaScript skills being utilised:
- Use of an array to store the hand history;
- Use of functions to store steps in code;
- Use of IsNaN and parseInt to ensure user inputs a number:

    ```javascript
    const passLenStr = prompt('How long would you like your passphrase? Enter a number between 10 and 64');
    // Convert user input to integer
    passLenOpt = parseInt(passLenStr);
    // Error message if input was not an integer
    if (isNaN(passLenOpt)) {
        alert('Invalid input. Please enter a number.');
    }
    ```

- Use of single and multiple arguments passed through function to limit amount of code used to create password;

    ```javascript
    let choiceOpt = getCharChoices();
    // 3. Combine correct character choices into new array
    charSelect = createNewArray(choiceOpt);
    // 4. Fill userPassword with for loop of random characters from step 3, until password length is reached
    userPassword = getRandom(charSelect, passLenOptInput);
    ```

- Use of Math.floor() and Maths.random() inside for loop for selecting random elements from charSelect to fill userPassword string with passLenOptInput length:
    
    ```javascript
    function getRandom(charSelect, passLenOptInput) {
      // Choose random characters from charSelect until passLenOptInput is filled with the correct number
      for(i = 0; i < passLenOptInput; i++) {
        let addChar = Math.floor(Math.random() * (charSelect.length));
        userPassword += charSelect[addChar];
      }
      return userPassword;
    }
    ```

- Use of .concat.apply to create one single array (charSelect) from nested array (charOptions):

    ```javascript
    // Arrange the array of arrays into one single array
    charSelect = [].concat.apply([], charOptions);
    return charSelect;
    ```

- Write password code block to run all the functions in the correct order;
- Reset options so that the user can generate a new password without refreshing the page.

## Suggested future changes

- Add checkboxes to html page so that user can select their options without using alerts, prompts and confirm;
- âœ… ~~Add a reset code block so new passwords can be generated without refreshing the page;~~
- Add code for when cancel button is selected on initial prompt for password length;
